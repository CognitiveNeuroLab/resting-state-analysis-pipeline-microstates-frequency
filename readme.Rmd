Resting state - Pre-process/Microstates/PowerFrequency</h1>

## About The Project

This is still a work in progress. This Repo will contain the full
pipeline to analyse resting state data, in Matlab using EEGlab. The
pipeline will contain everything from pre-processing to creating
microstates and doing a power/frequency analysis. This is work from [Ana
Francisco](https://github.com/anafrancisco) [Douwe
Horsthuis](https://github.com/DouweHorsthuis) and [Filip de
Sanctis](https://github.com/pdesanctis) in discussion with Sophie
Molholm.

## Resting state project

### Paradigm

This pipeline is build to analyse data collected using the Restingstate
paradigm in our lab. This paradigm is essentially a 5 min trial with a
fixation cross with the text "Please fixate on the cross" followed by a
5 min trial that has the text "please close your eyes". However, some of
our data is collected by telling the participant instead to just look at
the center of the screen, or to keep your eyes closed for 5 minutes. For
this reason, the pipeline might add the triggers to keep the eyes open
and eyes closed data separate.

### Groups

This data is collected for a lot of different groups. The script is
set-up in a way that you can analyse 1 to 3 groups in one go. However,
there is room to add another group or simply to run the script again for
a different group.

## Pipeline

### Raw data to .set and merge

This is normally pretty straight forward in EEGlab. But in this case we
have 3 different scripts, or variations of the same script.

#### A_bdf_merge_sets

The mostly used script is the A_bdf_merge_sets. This simply takes the
Raw data (.bdf) and turns it into a .set file

#### A_bdf_non_paradigm_merge_sets

Then there is the A_bdf_non_paradigm_merge_sets. Since some of the data
is collected without a paradigm but is saved into 2 separate files
without triggers, this script solves that. It loads the .bdf file that
ends in \_open.bdf and adds a eyes open trigger to the start. It does
the same for the .bdf file ending in \_closed with the exception that
here it adds and eyes closed trigger. Lastly it merges the two files
into one.

#### A_XDF_merge_sets

The third script load XDF files. These are files that have both EEG data
and [Optitrack](https://optitrack.com/) movement data.  
This script loads the xdf file (1 file per participant) and deletes the
data that is not in the EEG channels or in the first channel. The first
channel has all the trigger info. The script uses this channel to add
the trigger to the EEG data.

### Pre processing

#### B_preprocess1

This script is the first of the pre-processing scripts. It runs all the
people in order of their group.  
One of the issues we encountered was that some participants had their
data collected using the wrong configuration file. This is taken care
of.  
The data is down-sampled from 512Hz to 256 Hz.  
Externals are all deleted since not everyone has externals. So we cannot
use them as a reference.  
We apply a 1Hz and 50Hz filter. We add channel info to all the channel.
For this we use the following 3 files: standard-10-5-cap385, BioSemi160,
BioSemi64. The first 2 are from BESA and have the correct layout. The
3rd is needed for the MoBI data. You can find these in the Functions and
files folder (inside the src folder).  
Lastly this script uses eeglab's clean_artifacts function deletes the
bad channels and bad parts of data. Channels will get deleted by the
standard noise criteria, if they are flat over 5 seconds and the
function checks if channels are overly correlated with each other.After
that it devides the data in 0.5 second epochs. In these it looks if
there data has peaks that go over 35 standard deviantion of the channels
amplitlude. If so these get deleted. Because it's possible that between
2 of these moments there is a very short amount of data, we make sure to
delete all the continues data if between 2 boundries there is less then
2 seconds of data. We got to the criteria of 35, because 20 is the
default setting, but because resting state data is different from task
based data, we had to find out a way that we still had enough data left,
without it being noisy.

#### C_manual_check

This script plots all the data in EEGlab as continues data and allows
you to delete channels manually.

#### D_preprocces2

This script will double check and fix any potential trigger issue we
encountered. It saves a Matrix with the information for each individual
participant. **This script can be skipped** It is only useful for
documenting triggers. ~~We added the
[pop_rejcont](https://github.com/wojzaremba/active-delays/blob/master/external_tools/eeglab11_0_4_3b/functions/popfunc/pop_rejcont.m)
in the next script and this deletes triggers sometimes, so we need to
double check triggers again (see [G_preprocces5](#g_preprocces5)).~~
Since off the 12/6/2021 update this is not the case. The clean_artifacts
takes care of noisy continues data. But it might be good to run either
script since they are quick. If you want to save time, skip this one.

#### E_preprocces3

This script loads a file with all the original channels, deletes the
externals and uses these file locations to interpolate the channels of
the corresponding subject's data. In the case of 160 channel data, it
uses the
[transform_n\_channels](https://github.com/CognitiveNeuroLab/Interpolating_160ch_to_64ch_eeglab)
function to interpolate the remaining channels not to the original 160,
but to 64 channel data so that it is the same as all the other data. For
this to work Matlab needs to know the location of 2 things, the
trannsform_n\_channel.m file and the EEG files called 64.set and 64.fdt.
We chose to interpolate before the ICA because like this we can still
use the ICA weights for all the channels, and since we are setting a PCA
(amount of ICs we want the ICA funtion to create) we account for the
interpolated channels not being used for this.

This script will do an average reference.  
This is followed by an [Independent Component
Analysis](https://eeglab.org/tutorials/06_RejectArtifacts/RunICA.html).
We use the pca option to prevent rank-deficiencies, as best as we can.
We set it to be all channels before interpolation - 1. We don't want
more because this gives "Ghost ICs" that are duplicates of existing
ones. We also exclude an extra IC because of the avg ref, hence the -1.
After his we delete eye, muscle and channel noise components by using
[IClabel](https://github.com/sccn/ICLabel). IClabel will only delete the
component if it has more than 70% eye data or 80% muscle or 70% channel
noise and always less then 10% brain data. Normally we only delete eye
components (\>0.8), and we arrived at this criteria after comparing (for
a different dataset) how many components we (Ana, Douwe and Filip) would
delete manually and what threshold would get the closest to that.
However, since this is different data, and it's un epoched so its harder
to clean, we decided to also delete extra components.

#### G_preprocces4

In this script, we first make sure that the triggers are still in the
right place. It is possible that the triggers got deleted if the
corresponding continues data were too noisy. If they got deleted, the
scripts calculates what the time of the onset of that deleted part of
data was and uses that instead as the latency of the trigger. This
should already be fixed before, but this is a double check.

### Power Frequency Analysis

After that we use the the [pwelch function of
Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/pwelch.html) and a log
transformation of the results to get the power frequency results.

for now we are only using 1 pre-selected channel to save data. This data
can either be saved as an excel file, which is easy to use for stats in
different platforms, or as a table or individual variable in Matlab.

### Microstates

The main Microstate analysis follows the instructions as written [On the website of the developer](https://www.thomaskoenig.ch/index.php/software/microstates-in-eeglab/getting-started) [Thomas Konig](https://www.thomaskoenig.ch/index.php/publication-list) of the microstate toolbox that we use. Using his microstate plugin, and [ragu software](https://www.thomaskoenig.ch/index.php/software/ragu/getting-started1) the final part was analyised. The plugin itself has a script `RunMicrostateAnalysis` which we used to do the analysis for everyone. 

#### Extra functions

Because this script uses both 160 and 64 channel collected with biosemi
caps we needed to get the to a same format. To do this we are using the
transform_n\_channels function [documented
here](https://github.com/CognitiveNeuroLab/Interpolating-channels-between-different-cap-sizes).
In this case it turns all the 160 channel data into 64 channels. But it
will keep the original channels that are closed to the location of the
corresponding 64ch cap.

## 2023 microstate paper  
All the code used for this paper is located in the 2023 paper folder. While almost everything is the same as the pipeline there are some small differences, for example, we did not have to use the XDF files nor did we use 160 channel data (only 64 channels) so no transformation has been used.
