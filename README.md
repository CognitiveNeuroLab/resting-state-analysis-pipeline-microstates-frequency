<h3 align="center">N-Back Task</h3>

<h4 align="center">This is still a work in progress. This Repo will contain the full pipeline to analyse resting state data, in Matlab using EEGlab. The pipeline will contain everything from pre-processing to creating microstates and doing a power/frequency analysis. This is work from Ana Francisco Douwe Horsthuis and Filip de Sanctis
